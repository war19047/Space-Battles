# Overview

I am trying to get better at Object Oriented Programming. I thought developing a simple game would help me to gain more skills in this programming paradigm. 

My game is a work in progress at the moment. I am trying to develop a game similar to Space Invaders. The game is rather simple to play. You have a ship at the bottom of the screen that can shoot. Enemies approach from the top of the screen and you try to eliminate them before they eliminate you.

My purpose in writing this software is to create a fun game that teaches me about OOP. Also, to improves my skills and understanding in the Python language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4â€“5-minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Future Work

I have a lot of things that I need to implement in my game for it to be complete. 
* Add enemy sprites.
* get player to shoot.
* Add collision detection for the bullets.
* Implement a player score.
